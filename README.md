Architecture for this functionality

This is an example to demonstrate sample REACT application calling AWS API gateway REST API to add data to DynamoDB (AWS NoSQL DB)

## Step1: 
Clone the repo 
`$git clone https://github.com/jackieb108/AWSLambdaReactDynamoExample.git`


## Step2:
Create DynamodDB with 'date' as the key

## Step3:
Create 'collegeAppTuition' Lambda function on AWS. Copy other/awslambdaindex.js to index.js in Lambda function

## Step4:
Create API Gateway on AWS - collegetuitionAppFunction-API

After all resources are deployed on AWS, update src/Form.js to point to coorect URL location 

## Step5:
Update file src/Form.js' to point to correct lambda function
async handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const { name, message } = this.state;
    await axios.post(
      `'https://[REPLACE].amazonaws.com/default/collegetuitionAppFunction'`,
      { collegedata: `${name}, ${message}` }
    );
  }


Start teh webapp
## Step6:
 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Step6:
Add some relevant data in the web application and hit 'Add' button

Review the DynamoDB items and you should see the data entered via the webapp

## Default Documentation generated by npm!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
